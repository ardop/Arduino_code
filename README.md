# Arduino_code

Arduino code for initial tracking tests and control. 

"ardop_eyes_final" is the code that allows the robot to display any emotion or pattern on its LED display. A set of serial input codes is given to light up the right LED's. Persistence of vision implemented using Shift Registers is used to display the required emotion. 

For testing, the python application in the "Python_code" repository is used. The GUI application allows users to set any pattern. The application then produces specific coordinate codes which can then be used to display the pattern on the hardware.
